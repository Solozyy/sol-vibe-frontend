### Which do you prefer: e-books or books? Give reasons or examples to support your opinion.

I'm prefer traditional books over e-book for serveral reasons, rooted in their tactile, emotional, and sensory experiences. While both have their own merits, books offer a unique experience that e-books cannot fully replicate.

First, books are physical objects that you can hold, flip through, and mark up with notes and highlights. The feel of sitting down in ground and turning the pages, hear the sound of the pages turning, and the smell of the paper is a impressive experience. And i'm always feel i have a better focus on the content when i'm reading a physical book.

Second, books are a social experience. You can read a book with friends and discuss the content, share your favorite quotes, and recommend books to each other. E-books, on the other hand, are a solitary experience. You can read an e-book on your own, but you can't share it with friends.

Third, books are a source of inspiration and creativity. They can spark ideas, evoke emotions, and provide a source of inspiration. E-books, on the other hand, are a source of information and knowledge. They can provide a source of information and knowledge, but they can't provide a source of inspiration and creativity.

Fourth, I think i'm a nostalgic person, all my childhood memories are associated with books. I always remember the feeling of reading a book in my grandmother's house, with the excitement of knowledge and adventure. That's the memories that i'm always going to cherish.

However, in the era of digitalization, e-books have many advantages over traditional books. They are more convenient to carry, and they are more affordable. They are also more environmentally friendly. Althou
